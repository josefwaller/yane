# Example 4 - iNes to executable
Compiles Yane with a constant iNes file to create a standalone executable.
Essentially turns an iNes file into a native executable file by wrapping it wth Yane's interface.
By replacing `thwaite.nes` with your own iNes file, you can compile your game to a standard executable.
